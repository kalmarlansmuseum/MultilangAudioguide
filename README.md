# MultilangAudioguide
A multi lang audio guide site profile for [ProcessWire](https://github.com/processwire/processwire).

* Profile has three languages added, add/remove for your own needs.
* Easily tweak theme by UIKit 3 LESS files.
* Uses Amplitude.js for audio playback. 

Inspired by the [ACMI audio guide](https://github.com/ACMILabs/static-museum-audio-guide). Thanks for sharing!
